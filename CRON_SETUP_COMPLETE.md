# ✅ Cron Scheduling Setup Complete

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Automated daily news scraping at 7:00 AM PDT

## 📦 What Was Created

The following files have been set up for automated news scraping:

### 1. Execution Scripts

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `cron_scrape.sh` | Main cron job script that runs the scraper | ✅ Executable |
| `setup_cron.sh` | Interactive setup wizard for easy installation | ✅ Executable |

### 2. Documentation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CRON_QUICK_START.md` | Quick reference guide for common tasks |
| `CRON_SETUP_GUIDE.md` | Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting documentation |
| `CRON_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` | This summary document |

### 3. Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `logs/` | Stores cron execution logs (`cron.log`) |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Installation

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script

```bash
cd /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener
./setup_cron.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Verify all files are in place
- ✅ Create necessary directories
- ✅ Show timezone information
- ✅ Offer automatic or manual installation
- ✅ Let you test the scraper

### Step 2: Choose Installation Method

When prompted, select **Option 1** (recommended):
```
1) Install with automatic DST adjustment (RECOMMENDED)
```

This will add the cron job to run at 7:00 AM Pacific Time every day.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
crontab -l
```

You should see:
```cron
0 7 * * * TZ='America/Los_Angeles' /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/cron_scrape.sh >> /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

- **Time:** 7:00 AM Pacific Time
- **Frequency:** Daily

### What It Does
1. Activates Python environment
2. Runs `auto_scrape.py` to fetch news from all active sources
3. Saves new articles to database
4. Analyzes for Haryana relevance
5. Categorizes by topic
6. Logs results to `logs/cron.log`

### Duration

## 📊 Monitoring

### View Logs
```bash
# See latest activity
tail -50 logs/cron.log

# Follow logs in real-time
tail -f logs/cron.log

# View today's scraping
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" logs/cron.log
```

### Check Last Run
```bash
# See most recent cron execution
tail -20 logs/cron.log
```

### Verify Cron Job
```bash
# List all cron jobs
crontab -l

# Check for the news scraper job
crontab -l | grep cron_scrape
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Before First Scheduled Run

```bash
# Test the complete cron script
bash cron_scrape.sh

# Or test the Python scraper directly
python3 auto_scrape.py
```

This will:
- Verify your environment is set up correctly
- Show you what output to expect
- Confirm articles are being scraped and saved

---

## 📱 Accessing Scraped Articles

After the cron job runs (or after manual testing):

### 1. Start Backend (if not running)
```bash
cd backend
python3 main.py
```

### 2. Open Web Interface
```
http://localhost:3000/haryana
```

### 3. Browse Articles
- Filter by category (Tourism, Infrastructure, Economy, etc.)
- Filter by sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- Set minimum relevance score
- Post to Twitter directly from the interface

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Schedule

Edit crontab to modify when scraping runs:
```bash
crontab -e
```

**Examples:**

```cron
# Twice daily (7 AM and 7 PM)
0 7,19 * * * TZ='America/Los_Angeles' /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/cron_scrape.sh >> /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/logs/cron.log 2>&1

# Every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * TZ='America/Los_Angeles' /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/cron_scrape.sh >> /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/logs/cron.log 2>&1

# Every Monday only
0 7 * * 1 TZ='America/Los_Angeles' /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/cron_scrape.sh >> /Users/nimeshkhatri/github/news-screener/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

### Modify Scraping Behavior

Edit `auto_scrape.py` to:
- Change which sources are scraped
- Adjust delays between requests
- Modify output verbosity
- Add email notifications (requires additional setup)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Cron Job Not Running
```bash
# Verify installation
crontab -l

# Check script permissions
ls -l cron_scrape.sh

# Test manually
bash cron_scrape.sh

# Check macOS cron permissions
# System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Full Disk Access
# Add /usr/sbin/cron
```

#### 2. Script Runs But No Articles
```bash
# Check logs for errors
tail -100 logs/cron.log

# Verify database exists
ls -l news_screener.db

# Test sources manually
python3 scrape_haryana_news.py
```

#### 3. Wrong Timezone
```bash
# Check system timezone
date

# Verify cron uses Pacific Time
grep "TZ=" ~/.crontab 2>/dev/null || crontab -l | grep "TZ="
```

#### 4. Permission Errors
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x cron_scrape.sh setup_cron.sh

# Check log directory permissions
ls -ld logs/
```
