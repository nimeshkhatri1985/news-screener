- Example: Check both "Infrastructure" and "Economy" for development news

### 3. **Monitor Trends Over Time**
- Regular checks help you identify patterns
- Notice which types of news are more common
- Track sentiment changes over time

### 4. **Customize Keywords**
- If you're not finding relevant articles, check the keywords
- Add industry-specific terms or local place names
- Remove overly broad keywords that match too many articles

### 5. **Balance Positive and Negative**
- Don't ignore negative sentiment articles
- Understanding challenges helps create balanced content
- Use negative articles to identify areas needing attention

## Troubleshooting

### No Articles Found
- **Check if sources are active**: Go to Sources page
- **Verify database has articles**: Run the scraper to fetch news
- **Lower the minimum score**: Try setting it to 0
- **Check sentiment filter**: Try "All Sentiments"

### Irrelevant Articles Showing
- **Increase minimum score**: Set to 30 or higher
- **Review keywords**: Some keywords might be too broad

### Sentiment Seems Wrong
- Review the positive/negative indicators shown
- The system uses keyword matching, not deep semantic analysis
